    <h3>General Instructions</h3>

    <p>
        Please pay careful attention to the instructions. You will be asked to make decisions
        in a series of different tasks and precise rules will be provided before you start each
        type of task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your final earnings today will depend partly on your decisions, partly on the decisions
        of others and partly on chance. At the end of the experiment, you will be paid in cash.
        All payments will be made in private using and envelope. Also, you will receive
        additional {{ participation_fee }} as a participation fee.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the experiment we will use <strong>Experimental Tokens</strong> instead of dollars.
        At the end of the experiment, your earnings in tokens will be translated into dollars.
        You will receive 1 dollar for every 5 tokens you have earned in the session.
        It is important that you do not talk or in any way try to communicate with other
        people during the session. If you have a question, raise your hand and an experimenter
        will attend to your station to answer your question privately. The experiment should
        be finished in approximately one hour.
    </p>

    <h3>Pairs</h3>

    <p>
        At the beginning of the experiment, you will be randomly and anonymously matched with
        one other participant to form a pair. Within each pair there will be one person with
        the role of <i style="color: #1b6d85">Decider</i> and another person with the role of
        <i style="color: #1b6d85">Partner</i>. These roles will
        be assigned randomly within each pair, and will remain for the entire session.
        Only choices made by the Decider will determine final payoffs. Partner choices
        will not determine anyoneâ€™s payoffs.
        Roles, however, will be disclosed after the last decision has been made.
        Finally, participants will not learn the identity of his/her counterpart at any moment of the session.

    </p>

    <h3>Tasks, Decision Rounds and Earnings</h3>

    <p>
        This experiment will consist of a series of decision rounds of {{ Constants.number_types_of_tasks }}
        different types of tasks. Each kind of task will be explained later.
        At the end of all decisions, your role (Decider or Partner) will be disclosed.
        Then the computer will randomly select one choice made by the Decider and generate payoffs
        for both member of the pair based on that selected choice.
        The selected choice as well as the final payoffs it generates will be disclosed to both participants.
    </p>
