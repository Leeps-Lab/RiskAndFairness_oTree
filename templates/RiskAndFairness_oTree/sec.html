        <p>
           In each decision round, there will be two probable states: State A and State B. Think of these states as the weather: it could be either sunny or cloudy. However, when you make your decision, it is uncertain which state will occur.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your decision will be represented by a point on a graph like the one in the figure below. In this graph, the horizontal axis indicates Tokens paid if State A occurs, and the vertical axis indicates Tokens paid if State B occurs. The chance that each state will occur is displayed in parentheses on the corresponding axis label. In sample screen-shot, for instance, the probability of State A is 50%, and the probability of State B is 50%, as well. However, be aware that these probabilities might be different in different decision rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The position of a point on this graph represents a lottery. For example, the point on location (40, 20) indicates that if State A is realized, the lottery pays 40 tokens; and if State B is realized, the lottery pays 20 tokens. <i style="color: blue"> your lottery  will be depicted by a blue square, and </i> and <i style="color: orange"> Partnerâ€™s lottery by an orange circle </i>.
