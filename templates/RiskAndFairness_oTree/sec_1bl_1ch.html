    <p>
       In each decision round, there will be two probable states: State A and State B. Think of these states as the weather: it could be either sunny or cloudy. However, when you make your decision, it is uncertain which state will occur.
    </p>

    <p>
Your decision will be represented by a point on a graph like the one in the figure below. In this graph, the horizontal axis indicates Tokens paid if State A occurs, and the vertical axis indicates Tokens paid if State B occurs. The chance that each state will occur is displayed in parentheses on the corresponding axis label. In sample screen-shot, for instance, the probability of State A is 50%, and the probability of State B is 50%, as well. However, beware that these probabilities might be different in different decision rounds.
    </p>

    <p>
    The position of a point on this graph represents a lottery. For example, the point on location (40, 27) indicates that if State A is realized, the lottery pays 40 tokens; and if State B is realized, the lottery pays 27 tokens. <i style="color: blue"> your lottery  will be depicted by a blue square, and </i> and <i style="color: orange"> Partnerâ€™s lottery by an orange circle </i>.

        In the graph, the size of each outcome bubble will increase with the chances it is given.
        You can try as many combinations as you want before you submit your decision.
        The same information of the graph is displayed in the table below the slider bar.
        Throughout this session, <b style="color: blue"> your tokens will be represented in blue </b> and
        your <b style="color: orange"> Partner's tokens in orange</b>.

        Once you make your choice, press the submit decision button and continue to the next round.
        If you do not make a choice (do not move the slider to your preferred position, the computer will return an error.
        Please think your decisions carefully. If at the end of the session, this Decision Round is selected to be paid.
        The computer will randomly choose outcome A or B according with the probabilities you decided
        and will pay you and your partner accordingly.
